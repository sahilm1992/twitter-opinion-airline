 what you did was illegal and a breach of contract i will be in touch but not through your customer feedback
 its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru
 yes we are in ewr and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
 please review and fix your baggage procedures at dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
 nothing else from you gj where is your customer service
 thats of course in lax
 oh no im rebooked 7 hours after my original arrival time we can talk compensation
 my coworker that had the same conflict as me with the hotel issue trying to share posted on their facebook page and they erased it
