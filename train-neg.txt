 sf crew lack a lot of customer service lax employees are a lot better wonder why
 thats why i missed my flight if the flight had been held for 5 minutes i would have made it i watched it pull away from the gate

 your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the tarmac didnt have a gate agent once we got a gate

 youve got to be kidding me i still havent talked to a human and your robotweeting me and asking for a follow
 i wouldnt describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience to help you might find my baggage you lost amp return it
 and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
 is that all that matters not the fact that were at a different destination we were put through a tremendous amount of stress

 love to report how horrible this flight is to your team lets make it worseas they get to my seatout of all snacks
 you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights cancelled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost you never get it right
 its worth saying that if you litter in singapore you get caned but there are rules says 
 why i wont check my carry on watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min URL
 why so i can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message disappointing as always
 this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
 not 100 sure however my ticket included one checked bag therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated
 terribly disappointed confirmed reservation delayed and your cust service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution
 this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours i am not impressed at all
 its my one and only checked bag which is checked to edinburgh however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark
 with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport

 the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and returned back in o gate that should not count as a valid journey
 yes it is partly used the del-ewr is used the return flight was cancelled due to technical glitch in operations
 i appreciate you looking can you compensate me on anything for my troubles still havent taken off for a 1030 am flight
